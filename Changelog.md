3.1.0  
* Adds support for PF1 Buffs (Active Effects)  
* Adds support for PF2e Ruleset Items (Active Effect types)  
  
**PF1**  
Existing System buffs can be defined from the Automatic Recognition Menu (Active Effects Tab) to play the effect when the Buff is toggled on. If set to persistent, the animation will end when the Buff is toggled off. Buffs can have customized animations when created and added to the Buff tab of the token/actor sheet.  
The "Buffs" created this way are essentially Items that create Active Effects when toggled on/off.  
  
**PF2e**  
Existing "Conditions" (i.e. those on the Token HUD) can be defined from the Automatic Recognition Menu (Active Effects Tab). The same goes for All Ruleset effect types that are applied to Token via drag-n-drop. These effects can also have animations defined on the Items, which will take precendence over the Autorec menu. Effects set to persistent will auto-delete when the Effect is ended, or toggled off.  
  
This is the initial support for the active effect integration for these 2 systems. I will look at expanding the functionality of each as necessary. For instance, providing a way in PF2e to define different animations for Condtions when they are set to a stacked level (1, 2, 3). Please log any Bugs or Feature requests on the Automated Animations GitHub page.  
  
3.0.2  
* Fixed Persistent options for Items in the Template menu where the Square option was not correctly adding the Tile options  
* Added actual functionality to the "Delay Start" option for the Active Effect menus. When set, this will delay the start/application of the animation after the Active Effect is created in Milliseconds  
* Added hover tool-tips to the new Unbind Alpha and Unbind Visibility menu options  
  
3.0.1  
* Removed the Merge and Import buttons from the Autorec Menu. These are now in a Single Overwrite/Merge button. When used you can choose to Overwrite or Merge the incoming Menu.  
  
3.0.0 **Active Effect Series**  
* Added a Merge Menus button to the Automatic Recognition menu. When used, it will prompt you to choose a menu to import. This gives 100% priority to your existing menu, and only adds new fields being Merged from the incoming menu. ALWAYS review the merged menus to ensure you don't have strange duplicates so you know what you are getting.  
* Added **Unbind Alpha** and **Unbind Visibility** to relevant A-A menus. This is useful for Persistent effects so you can choose whether the Animation remains visible even if the Token it is attached to goes invisible, or if you change it's Opacity.  
* Updated A-A Databases to be current with the latest JB2A 4.0 release. This also addes in the Generic/UI animations that had previously been missing, Lightning Strikes and a few others.  
  
* **DnD 5e Active Effects integration** - The beginning of the A-A Active Effect series provides full integration into the 5e Active Effect system. Check out the A-A Wiki for more information at https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations/wiki/Active-Effect-Integration  
* Module Setting added for DnD 5e to Disable Active Effect Animations, useful for future troubleshooting  
* I have provided an Autorec Mergable list for 5e for both the JB2A Patreon and Free versions that can be imported from the following location in the Modules folder: ``modules/autoanimations/active-effects/dnd5e``. For remote hosted users that may not easily be able to access this, I will provide these files on the A-A Announcements page (pinned) on the JB2A Discord for download.  
* Further Active Effect integration for other systems will be ongoing, starting with PF2e and PF1. If your system is currently supported by A-A, and you know it utilizes some form of the Active Effects system in Foundry, feel free to log a Feature Request on the A-A GitHub issues page and let me know.  
  
2.1.6 **Warhammer and SWADE fixes**  
* Fixes A-A not working with the Warhammer rpg system thanks to silent_mark  
* Fixes a range check issue in the SWADE system where Melee to Range switch animations were not working properly  
  
2.1.5  **PF2e Fallback and DCC Addition**  
* Adds a fallback method for PF2e weapons where if no Automatic Recognition settings were found, it will default to the base weapon type and attempt to match that. Addition thanks to CarlosFdez on GitHub  
* Add support for the DCC system thanks to Gazkhan of JB2A  

2.1.4 **Database Fixes**  
* Corrected some items in the Free JB2A database (Eruption and Divine Smite)  
* Added Detect Magic to the Aura and Template menus  
  
2.1.3 **Fixes and Changes**  
* Added a missing option in the Automatic Recognition Menu for macros: Only Macro, no Animation. This will disregard any animation settings to allow you to only run a macro when the item is rolled.  
* Added missing "explosions" for the On Token menu when the Play On field was set to Source Token  
* In most cases, the Template Data should now be passed to the Macro ARGS  
* Added the item UUID tag to Persistent effects placed as Tiles under ``tile.data.flags.autoanimations.origin``  
  
2.0.0 **Macro Support**  
**BREAKING** With the addition of Macros into A-A, the Advanced Macros module is required to use this feature. This will not be set as a dependency since it is an optional feature of the Module.  
* Adds the ability to use Custom Macros on all Item and Automatic Recognition Menus. **See the WIKI for detailed information on how to use these at** https://github.com/otigon/automated-jb2a-animations/wiki/Adding-Macros.  
* All Animation Sequences have been reworked to accomodate the Addition of Macros. As such, you may notice some different behavior on some animations. The basic Sequence will work as:  
1. Macro (If playing in Sequence)  
2. Extra Effects - Source Token (If Enabled)  
3. Primary Effect and Sound.  
4. Explosion (if enabled)  
5. Extra Effects - Target Token(s) (If Enabled)  
**NOTE:** For Targeted effects, 3, 4 and 5 will play on all targets Simultaneously (respecting wait/delay times) with any associated Sounds. Previously many of the effects would incorrectly play the full Sequence from Source to Target, then Repeat again for the next target.  
  

* All menus should now have have proper placeholders representing the default value if the field is left blank.  
* Corrected an issue with Templates => Thunderwave. Previously if the Thunderwave animation was chosen it would direct it to a custom Sequence designed for DnD 5e. This is now moved to the Preset menus.  
  
  
1.2.9 **JB2A Essek and Frumpkin add-ins  
Adds in all new animations with exception of the Zoning effects  
* Energy Conduit Square and Circle => Range-Generic  
* Energy Beam variant 02 and 03 => Range-Spell-Energy Beam  
* Energy Strands (Multiple) variant 02 => Range-Spell-Energy Strands  
* Eruption and Liquid Splash => added to OnToken Type Explosion, Explosion Menus, and Extra Effect menus  
* Aura option "Ignore Targets" is now working correctly
  
1.2.8 **Adds support for external Animation calls to utilize Play of Miss effects via option object that accepts and array of the Hit Targets, and an option to override the Play on Miss feature in A-A  
  
1.2.3  
* **Adds support for the OSE system**  
* Teleportation preset will now activate immediately on Item use  
* New "Dual Attach" preset is now available in the Preset menus. **NOTE, this is an experimental feature that can sometimes be buggy**  
* 
1.2.0  
* **SOCKETLIB IS NOW A DEPENDANCY**. I've listed this as such since Sequencer 2.0 will require it as well.  
* Fix for Shadow of the Demonlord animations running on every button press  
* Fix for Forbidden Lands system animations failing if the "Link Actor Data" option was checked on the token  
* Updates for Template Animations and Teleportation Preset animation  
* Template Animations now accept both ScaleX and ScaleY. Keep both the same for uniformity  
Teleport Preset  
* Now accepts a Start and End animation separately, with custom option for both  
* New option to set the Grid Measurement type for either 5/5/5 or 5/10/5. Spawning either a Circular or Square overlay to show distance on use.  
* Teleportation no longer summons a Template. Now a simple Border is used via Sequencer, colored as the User Color.  
* Removed the "Do Not Show Template" option. Replaced with "Hide From Players. This is a GM ONLY setting, and ONLY on the Item menus. If checked, the distance border will only be visible to the GM, and not the Players (Great for hiding the BBG escaping)  
* In the 2nd Animation field, you can set the "Delay (ms) Token Alpha". This option accepts positive and negative values to time the reapperance of the Token. Token is no longer put in a hidden state, but the Alpha is changed by Sequencer. Base value for reappearing is time for Misty Step animation.  
  
1.1.0 - 1.1.6  
* Support for the 3D Canvas module by Ripper. Adds 3D Canvas Particle animations to all item menus, and the Melee, Range and On Token Autorec Menus.  
* Added SORT button to the Autorec Menu to sort your menu alphabetically  
* Added Global setting to Decouple Sounds from animations. If checked, Sounds will NOT repeat with the animation they are assigned to.  
* Fixed some issues with the 5e Magic Items module and Template animations not working correctly  
  
1.0.1 and 1.0.2  
* Corrected Automatic Recognition Menu import errors.  
* Automatic Recognition Menu is now localized. This only affects new installations. Command line prompt of game.settings.set('autoanimations-modded', 'aaAutorec') will revert your menu to the base menu, but localized if you need to change it.  
* Updated menus for the JB2A Darrington release (minus Side Impacts for now)  
* Updated Japanese localization file thanks to Touge  
  
1.0.0  
**Feature Upgrades**  
* PF2e - Animate on Hit and Miss. Enabled in the Module Settings. Does not function if animating on Damage Rolls. Requires only 1 token to be targeted when rolling the attack (otherwise PF2e does not run the check)  
* Automatic Recognition Menu: Submit & Submit and Close button added. Submit will save the current settings and NOT close the menu, while Submit and Close will save and close.  
* Automatic Recognition Menu: Duplicate button added to sections to quickly copy an existing section to a new one.  
* Aura animations will now play immediately on Item use, irrespective of Attack and/or Damage rolls.  
* Generic Damage animations: Generic option in Melee menu will now only show if the Patreon Package is installed. Generic options are also now available in the Automatic Recognition Menu.  
  
**SOUNDS/AUDIO**  
* Sound options have been added to ALL animation sections on Item Menus AND Automatic Recognition Menus.  
* If animations are disabled on an item, you will still have the option to only play a Sound if so desired.  
* Existing sounds should still remain in place  
* Sounds are tied directly to the animations that they are defined on. Options are Volume and Delay.  
* Delay for sounds accepts both negative (-) and positive (+) numbers to start later or sooner than the animation.  
  
0.5.0  
* BREAKING: SEQUENCER module is now a Dependency of Automated Animations. You MUST have it installed and ACTIVE
* BREAKING: Weapon Animations with Explosions added will need to be reconfigured. Explosion options changed slightly
* BREAKING: Removed Token Magic FX support. This will be added back in on a future update with more customizable options
* BREAKING: Removed the Targetting Assistant in the module settings. This may or may not make it back in later
* BREAKING: Most currently set animations/items will work. There may be some instances where a custom configured item will need to be reconfigured. I did my best to limit the amount of breaking in this update
* Standardized all options across most Animation Types. Most options can now use a Custom Animation through a File Picker
* Options available for all are Looping and Loop Delay. Set the Loops for animations as well as the delay between each loop
* Options: Some now have the availability to scale the animation on a per item basis. Those with that option automatically scale with the Token size, and can be tweaked
* SELF and TARGET Explosion options are now SELF and TARGET Effects
* Replaced Class Features with Custom Sequences
* NEW: Added Source and Target Token effects in a new Tab. Source effects play before the Primary Animation, and Target effects play after. All can be adjusted with the Delay setting, either a positive or negative number.

0.1.6 Release:  
- Initial Support for PF1

- Removed the dependency on JB2A Free Module. If you have the patreon module the free module will no longer be required to be installed and active.
- Added error notifications if NO JB2A module is installed.
- Added Pop-Up window with information and to let users know the module REQUIRES a JB2A module to be installed
- You can now switch the Cure Wounds / Healing Word animations. If switching Cure Wounds, add *heal* to the source field, then a color option (This will then use the generic healing animation). If using healing word, you can switch to the Cure Wounds animation by adding "cure wounds" to the source field.  
- Tweaked the scaling of ranged attacks/spells

0.1.0 Release:
- Shield spell animation now scales globally and to token size  
- Removed the item TYPE check. This prevented some animations being used on certain items

- Limited the color reading to source field only. Prevents some custom weapons from calling the wrong animation  
- Added Stutter TMFX to the Generic damage types  
- Added JB2A Free Module as a dependency in the module.js. For release through official channels this is required to prevent someone downloading the Automated Module and not having any JB2A modules installed, thus causing them to have a useless module. This is necessary until I find a work around for the issue. The Patreon version still works with this module  

0.0.8 Release:  
- Fix for custom items being imported with Source field = null  
- 
2.0.6 Release:
- Reconfigured the Token Magic FX filters to AutoDestroy themselves. This should improve the performance of the filters applying and deleting on The Forge.

- Fixed an error with Magic Missile where the animation would not play

- Added an optional Shield Spell animation effect (enable in settings). This temporarily utilizes the Anti-Life shell animation.

- Cleaned up the way the module directs traffic to avoid unnecessary checks.

- Added a new setting: Only Play Animation on Damage Rolls  
  Allows for further customization of animations and when they play

- Corrected the check for Free vs Patreon Module. It should now work for both.

  Designed for use on items that utilize templates.  
  You can set the color, variant, and radius of the explosion in the Source Field

- Added Exploding Arrows (See PDF for Keywords)  
  Add the word explode in the source field and then set the color, variant and radius of the explosion.

0.0.4 Release:
- Token Magic FX options are now ADDED and REMOVED selectively to the Token. This means they should remove themselves even if the affected token is untargeted (think dead).

- Now ONLY removes the Token Magic FX that were applied with the given animation. All pre-existing TMFX filters should remain active and not be deleted

- Melee-Range detection should now be working correctly, Big thanks to brkwsk for the help.

- Playing with the timing of different TFMX applications and Animations to help streamline when used on The Forge.
